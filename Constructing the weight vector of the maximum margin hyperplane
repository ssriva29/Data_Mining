# Problem 3

x1 <- c(1,2,2,0,1,0)
x2 <- c(1,2,0,0,0,1)
class <- c('blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'red','red','red')

# (a) Plot these six training points. Are the classes f+; ô€€€g linearly separable?
plot(x1, x2 , col = class)

# Yes both class are linearly seperable

# (b) Construct the weight vector of the maximum margin hyperplane by inspection and identify the support vectors.
# p1 ( 0, 1.5) p2 -> (1.5, 0)
# y = -x + b => b = y + x = 1.5 => x1 + x2 - 1.5 =0 
slope = (1.5-0)/(0-1.5)
intercept = 1.5

abline(intercept,slope)

# drawing margin
slope2 = -1 
intercept2 = 1
abline(intercept2, slope2, lty=2)

intercept3 = 2
abline(intercept3, slope2, lty=2)

#Weight vector
# equation of line is x1 + x2 - 1.5 =0  , weight vector w (1,1)

# (c) If you remove one of the support vectors does the size of the optimal margin decrease, stay the same, or increase? Explain.

# there will not be any effect if we remove one of the support vector as the closest point 
#which will give us the maximum margin plain will remain same.
# whereas, removing more than one point can effect size of optimal margin.
